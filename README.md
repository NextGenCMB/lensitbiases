# N1
N1 lensing bias calculation and tests


* ordering in loops

* FFT-based separable versions

* make it stand-alone

* include BB

* better impl. of lik-based estimators



## Now N1 devel really super fast!
# But some discontinuities issues...
(maybe interpolation of Filters and Cls?)

    * pyfftw -> does not change anything (?)
    * symmetries? -> Done
    * make it possible to call any given L by re-evaluting the weights func -> Dones
## Status: OK and great for stt, ftt. Ahh! for ptt trick was freq signs...
